Functions
=========
* Detects minecarts using a redstone signal from detector rail
* Can be set to either 'park' or 'pass' mode
* Switches its track position based on the mode that is set
* Notifies command server when a cart passes through, parks, or departs
* Reads a configuration to determine its detector side and redstone state required for 'pass' mode

Command Server Communication
============================
The application communicates with the command server wireless over rednet. When the application is not awaiting a minecart, it awaits a rednet request from the command server. The application communicates its actions to the command server using rednet messages sent to the command server.

Station Modes
=============
The station can be set to three modes. Each mode yields different behavior from the application. The three modes are 'park', 'pass', and 'listen'.

When the station is in 'listen' mode, the application simply listens for a rednet message from the command server. When a rednet message containing a command is detected, the corresponding actions are performed by the application. Examples of commands are deploying the minecart and putting the application into park and pass modes.

When the station is in 'park' mode, the rail position is switched to the park position and the application awaits detection of a minecart. Once a minecart has been detected, the application sends a rednet message to the command server indicating that the minecart has arrived, and the application returns to 'listen' mode.

when the station is in 'pass' mode, the rail position is switched to let the minecart pass. The application awaits detection of a minecart. Once the cart has been detected, the application sends a rednet message to the command server indicating that the cart has arrived and the application returns to 'listen' mode.

Cart Detection
==============
Minecarts are detected by awaiting a rednet signal on the side that has been configured to receive the detector signal. The application listens for the signal when the station is in 'pass' or 'park' mode. When a cart is detected, it notifies the command server via rednet message.

The detector input side is specified in the application's configuration file.

Configuration
=============
The application's configuration exists in a JSON configuration file. The configuration file stores:
* Detector input side
* Redstone status required to pass the cart (each setup differs)

Configuration data is retrieved from the file when the application starts.

Development
===========
1. Build configuration-loading and startup functionality
2. Create rednet communication functionality
3. Write functionality for each station mode
